## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The Linear Resgression shows the variables/coefficients that provides a non-random amount of variance to the MPG values are Ground_clearance and Vehicle_length. The slope of the linear model is not zero because the linear regression shows that some of the independent variables had a significant effect on the dependent variable. This linear model can predict the MPG of MechaCar Prototypes effectively as the R-squared value is 0.7149 with roughly 70% accuracy.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The total_summary shows us that the variance of the suspension coils does not exceed 100 PSI. But upon closer inspection when grouping the summary data with their own individual Manufacturing lot, the data tells us while the first two manufacturing lot meet the design specification and does not exceed the suspension coil variance with under 100 PSI the thrid lot exceeds the variance with 170.3 PSI.
